Welcome to the **Karnataka Data Lake** project! This GitHub repository encompasses various tasks and analyses focused on policy interventions, statistical modeling, and data visualization. Under the guidance of **Srinath Srinivasa**, the Dean of Research at IIITB, we aim to extract valuable insights from the vast data reservoir known as the Karnataka Data Lake.

## My Tasks
During the course of this project, I have taken on a range of responsibilities, including:

1. **Creating Data Stories**: These engaging narratives delve into various policy interventions, offering insights into their impact on specific indicators.

2. **Identification of Significant Elements**: I analyze the data to identify elements that wield significant influence over given factors, uncovering crucial patterns and relationships.

3. **Distribution of State Budget**: Utilizing linear regression significance surveys, I analyze the distribution of the state budget and examine the contributing factors.

4. **Predictive Impact Modeling**: My work involves building predictive models to forecast the impact of individual elements, enabling data-driven decision-making.

5. **Building Visual Analytics Dashboards**: Using WordPress, I craft interactive and visually appealing analytics dashboards, facilitating data exploration and comprehension.

6. **Tableau-transliteration Script**: Checkout the power of the my script using `googletrans` Python module as I employ it to automate the transliteration of raw data in the Tableau.

7. **Data Cleaning and Statistical Modeling**: I emphasize data cleanliness and leverage statistical modeling techniques to gain meaningful insights from complex datasets.

8. **GIS Mapping with Data Layer**: Through Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping, I create data layers that provide spatial perspectives and support geographic analysis.

9. **Tableau Storyboard Creation**: I specialize in constructing captivating Tableau storyboards that artfully communicate data-driven narratives.
